<p style="text-align: right" class="biggerfont">Hello my name is Mubarik but most people call me Moo! I would title myself as a creative coder working on the
    bounds of creating cleaver code but not using short cuts. My biggest hobby is eating new foods. (yes thats a hobby)
    Other than that check out the Developer Projects I have! I got two games and other tools in development. 
    If you aren't intrested in that you can check out some of my designs where it shows a time-laps of how I've developed my website and other projects to look 
    better though-out time. Anyways I gotta code, or read some more books. See ya Later! Best Regards, Moo! </p>
